# Web
Always check the source code with Ctrl+U

# Entry point
Enumerate everything, including enumerating what you just enumerated

# Exploits
Search for publicly available exploits or PoC to make sure no unnecessary shit is happening when exploiting it

# Enumeration
If the web application redirects everything back into it's main page, try enumerating it with Burp Suite built-in Spider tool

# Bypassing User-Agent Blacklist
Some application will not respond to common directory enumeration tool(Gobuster/Dirb) because it blocks the tool by checking the User Agent.
To bypass this, simply run the tool with a custom User Agent with it.
